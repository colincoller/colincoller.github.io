## Accountability

## Health and longevity

* ???

### Family

* Took A to an appointment and on a quick coffee date.
  * Slang: ["cheeks"](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cheeks) as in "Tim Hortons' apple fritters are cheeks"
  * Music: [Fish in a Birdcage](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3AFsnAC0H9hes71BeRypbq?si=m2ltgdlNSB2yP1TUt3X7wg), [Will Wood and the Tapeworms](https://open.spotify.com/artist/13pwqHspIhcy1IcAooefso?si=rCJxYBx7R1mLKZANRU4eMQ), [Madilyn Mei](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3MHgwXo5vVzHqGMKWRoLer?si=qBaos6WtTZWnKzofBKrdEg)

* Helped P build some Pokemon models he got for his birthday.

* ??? Family movie night?

### Work

* Started learning [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to power my GitHub Pages.

### Thoughts

* If Friday was my last day of work, does today count as unemployment, or do I get the weekend off before I need to worry about accountability?

* I have a tendency to learn just-in-time, and to learn only the parts relevant to what I'm trying to accomplish, and I'm going to have to really focus on learning new things systematically from beginning to end.
