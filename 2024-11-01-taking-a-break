# 2024-11-01 - Taking a break

## Taking a break
After 27 years in tech, the last 9 in executive roles, I've decided to quit my job and take a bit of a break. I've been running at full speed for a long time, and I'd like to take some time to slow down, relax, and find a better balance between myself, my family, and my career.

## Health and longevity
I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer last year. Thankfully, thyroid cancer is one of the least-aggressive, most-treatable, most-survivable forms of cancer. It's the "good cancer".[^1] After surgery and a few weeks of recovery, I'm cancer-free again.[^2] But that got me thinking seriously about my health and aging.

I've been a sedentary computer person all my life. I only started snowboarding in my 30s and working out seriously in my 40s, and I don't think there's been a week since where _some_ part of me hasn't been injured or exhausted in some way. It's already a struggle to get and stay fit and uninjured, and I can tell it's only going to get harder. The stats are that men from my generation will live 83 years on average, but only 69 years in good health. Now that my parents are in their 70s, I can see that demarcation point _very_ clearly. I have somewhere between 23 and 37 years of "good life" left. I want to spend those years on things that bring me health, joy and fulfillment.

## Family
My kids have gotten older and more complex. My daughter started middle school and has to navigate a new school, teacher, peer groups, social dynamics, and anxiety. Both kids hit puberty and immediately became 10x more emotional, becoming sullen and withdrawn for no obvious reason, starting fights with and annoying each other, dragging and stomping feet, slamming doors, and pulling away from my wife and I. Maybe because of this, I've found I value my time with them even more now than I did before. The high point of most weekdays right now are:
* When my daughter comes home from school for lunch and I get to cook for her and talk to her about her day.
* Teaching my son to cook.
* Bonding with my daughter over a shared love of music, videos, and memes. 
* When my son, after lights-out, asks "Can we talk for a bit?" 
* Mock outrage when my daughter camps out on my side of my bed. (Of the maybe 20 Lightning chargers scattered around the house, mine supposedly charges her iPad the fastest.)
* Helping both kids with homework. 

These moments really, really matter, and I want as many of them as I can get.

## Work
I've been in my current role for a little under 3 years. I joined Lever in early 2022. I'd worked at several scale-ups I'd really enjoyed[^3] and found that same special blend of product, team, culture, challenges, and opportunities at Lever. Unfortunately, Lever was acquired by Employ shortly after I joined, and was merged with several other acquired companies. Instead of Lever needing me to help make an already great product, team, and culture that much better, Employ needed me to help cut costs, consolidate, average, and stitch products together. The reasons I joined Lever just weren't true at Employ.[^4] If I'm going to throw myself into my work, it want to work for a great company, where the company, people, and work all inspire me.

## What's next
I don't really know what's next yet. I'm hoping to spend some time as a stay-at-home dad, doing things that bring me pleasure - spending time with my family, cooking, reading, listening to music, watching movies, working out, and maybe spending winter as a snowboard bum. Maybe I’ll find a new problem worth solving and start something on my own. Or, maybe there’s another Lever out there waiting for me. For now, I’m optimizing for health, joy and fulfillment.

## Open questions
There are a few things that worry me about taking a break. I'll need to figure out the answers to these questions:

* I've always had a job at the center of my daily routine. What will replace it? Will I spin off into idleness or purposelessness? Will I waste hours on TikTok and Reddit, and end the day not having accomplished anything?

* I've always had a job at the center of my social life. What will replace it? How will I keep from becoming isolated?

* I'm too young to retire and fully intend to work again. How will I keep my skills sharp to stay employable in an industry that's constantly changing, where ageism is very real?

* If I'm not mentally or physically engaged in work, I snack. How will I avoid eating all the food in the house?

[^1]: No cancer is actually good.

[^2]: I don't like to say I "survived" or "beat" cancer because of how low-risk and low-impact mine was. I had the exact same degree of "fight" with my tonsils as a young adult. Is it weird to gatekeep your own cancer because it "wasn't cancer enough"?

[^3]: Hello Eloquans and Uberflippers!

[^4]: Employ isn't a terrible company and many of the people I worked with there are great. I hope they're ultimately successful. It just isn't Lever.
